- **Geographic Scope:** Nashville metropolitan area
- **Key Fields:** Property addresses, sale prices, dates, owner information, parcel IDs

## üîç Data Cleaning Process

### **Phase 1: Data Quality Assessment** üîç
- **Baseline Analysis** - Record counts and data completeness evaluation
- **Null Value Identification** - Systematic analysis across all critical columns
- **Data Type Validation** - Ensuring appropriate field formats and constraints
- **Business Rule Verification** - Identifying violations of expected data patterns

### **Phase 2: Date Standardization** üìÖ
- **Problem Identified:** Inconsistent datetime formats containing unnecessary time components
- **Solution Implemented:** Systematic conversion to standardized date format using CONVERT() function
- **Business Impact:** Enabled accurate temporal analysis and reporting capabilities

### **Phase 3: Missing Data Imputation** üîß
- **Challenge:** Critical property addresses missing for numerous records
- **Advanced Solution:** Implemented intelligent self-join logic using ParcelID matching

- **Result:** Recovered missing address data without external data sources

### **Phase 4: Address Parsing & Standardization** üìç
- **Property Addresses:** Parsed using SUBSTRING() and CHARINDEX() techniques
- **Owner Addresses:** Advanced parsing using PARSENAME() for 3-component addresses
- **Geographic Standardization:** Separated addresses into distinct fields (Street, City, State)
- **Data Architecture:** Created normalized address structure for improved querying

### **Phase 5: Data Standardization** ‚úÖ
- **Issue:** Inconsistent boolean representations (Y/N vs Yes/No)
- **Implementation:** CASE statement logic for systematic value conversion
- **Quality Assurance:** Verified complete standardization across all records

### **Phase 6: Duplicate Detection & Analysis** üîç
- **Advanced Technique:** ROW_NUMBER() window function with multi-field PARTITION BY
- **Business Criteria:** ParcelID, PropertyAddress, SalePrice, SaleDate, LegalReference
- **Result:** Identified and documented duplicate records for business review

### **Phase 7: Statistical Analysis & Outlier Detection** üìä
- **Price Analytics:** Comprehensive market statistics (Min, Max, Average, Count)
- **Outlier Detection:** IQR (Interquartile Range) method for identifying unusual prices
- **Geographic Analysis:** Price distribution and trends across Nashville neighborhoods
- **Market Insights:** Data-driven insights into local real estate patterns

### **Phase 8: Data Validation & Quality Reporting** üìã
- **Comprehensive Validation:** Multi-dimensional quality checks post-cleaning
- **Success Metrics:** Quantitative assessment of cleaning effectiveness
- **Final Reporting:** Executive summary of data transformation results

## üöÄ Project Highlights

### **Advanced SQL Techniques**
```sql
-- Intelligent Missing Data Imputation
SELECT a.ParcelID, ISNULL(a.PropertyAddress, b.PropertyAddress) as CleanAddress
FROM NashvilleHousing a
JOIN NashvilleHousing b ON a.ParcelID = b.ParcelID 
WHERE a.PropertyAddress IS NULL;

-- Statistical Outlier Detection
WITH PriceQuartiles AS (
    SELECT PERCENTILE_CONT(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY SalePrice) as Q1,
           PERCENTILE_CONT(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY SalePrice) as Q3
    FROM NashvilleHousing
)
SELECT * FROM NashvilleHousing 
WHERE SalePrice < (Q1 - 1.5 * (Q3 - Q1)) OR SalePrice > (Q3 + 1.5 * (Q3 - Q1));
```
